1. **ESP32 Board**: This is your main controller.

2. **L298N Motor Driver**: This controls the motors.

   - Connect VCC to 5V on ESP32
   - Connect GND to GND on ESP32
   - Connect IN1 to GPIO 26 on ESP32
   - Connect IN2 to GPIO 25 on ESP32
   - Connect IN3 to GPIO 33 on ESP32
   - Connect IN4 to GPIO 32 on ESP32
   - Connect ENA and ENB to 5V (or to additional GPIO pins if you want software PWM control)

3. **DC Motors**: Connect these to the output terminals on the L298N.

   - Left motor to OUT1 and OUT2
   - Right motor to OUT3 and OUT4

4. **LEDs**: Connect these to the specified GPIO pins on the ESP32 through appropriate resistors (typically 220-330 ohms).

   - WiFi LED to GPIO 13
   - Error LED to GPIO 12
   - Forward LED to GPIO 14
   - Reverse LED to GPIO 27
   - Left LED to GPIO 16
   - Right LED to GPIO 17
   - Stop LED to GPIO 5

5. **Power Supply**:
   - Connect a suitable power supply to the L298N to power the motors. This is typically 6-12V depending on your motors.
   - The ESP32 can be powered via its USB port or through a 5V regulator connected to the motor power supply.

Key changes in the code:

1. PWM is now used for motor speed control.
2. The fetch interval has been increased to 1 second to reduce network load.
3. Motor control functions have been updated to use PWM.
4. Error handling has been improved.

Make sure to upload this code to your ESP32 board. After connecting everything as described, the RC car should respond to commands from the API endpoint more reliably and with better control over its movements.
